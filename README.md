### TKH_Final_Project
Final Flask Project at TKH Phase 1 (December, 2020)

https://final-project-at-tkh.herokuapp.com/  

I have scraped data from [this website](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/maternity-leave-by-country) comparing stats on Maternity Leave by country for 2020. I wrope a Python scraping script that targeted the data in the table on the website, cleaned up the data in the table, converted some data structures to the appropriate type and extracted the specific information needed. I wrote a script to create a database and I automated the process of storing the extracted data into my database. At last, I created a Flask Application that made my database accessible from the web, created app routes for 3 different views of my database, and deployed my API on Heroku.  
Technologies used: Python, Flask, Jinja, SQLite3, bs4, SqlAlchemy, jsonify, requests, HTML5, CSS3 and etc.
